I released my first commercial game, [PUTRID SHOT ULTRA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2053360/PUTRID_SHOT_ULTRA/), on 11/7/22. I spent 6 months working on this game in my free time for a total of about ~200 hours of work. In this post, I'll discuss the steam results of my game, my process, and some analysis on why my game performed the way it did.

## Summary of Results
My game sold 285 copies in 3 weeks following its release.

The initial sales spike comes from wishlist conversion. From there, the game hit 10 reviews by day 3 of the release (I had 4 friends write reviews and received 6 "organic" reviews very early on). I saw a massive spike in Discovery Queue traffic (from ~2000 visits to 15000 visits per day thanks to hitting 10 reviews). I did not notice a spike in sales due to the discovery queue traffic.

A handful of large youtubers made videos on the game:

* [Retromation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MQ3ALXQio)
* [UltraC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vu_DlMV3OE)

This caused the second "spike" in sales in the graph above. The larger channels that played it seemed to enjoy the game enough to finish a run, but didn't seem to *love* the game due to some critical balance issues.
A number of smaller youtubers made videos on the game as well, including [RogueAbyss](https://www.youtube.com/@rogueabyss), [ParaDyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWHi9VRWr4Q), and [HauntedHusband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTkhYLoughA).

The game launched with around 620 wishlists (I'll talk about how I built wishlists in a later section). The game currently has 15 positive reviews and a median playtime of around 47 minutes (this time seems to fluctuate, the highest it went was around 55 minutes and it started at around 30 minutes).

## Pre-release marketing
I released my steam page on 06/20/2022, meaning I had around 4-5 months to build wishlists.
Here's my wishlist graph annotated with each of my marketing activities:

My main takeaways:

1. Steam next fest had the best "bang for my buck", roughly 300 wishlists
2. Reddit posts were hit or miss, medium-effort, and usually got me anywhere from 10-30 wishlists
3. Crazygames was easy and got me ~50 wishlists

My twitter had a very small following before this game's release (I had around 150 followers). I had a couple decent tweets (150-200 likes) but those didn't seem to affect wishlists/sales in any noticeable way. Releasing the game did get me about 100 additional twitter followers, so that was neat.

The amazing steam capsule was done by the amazing [Guilherme Holz](https://www.artstation.com/gholz). He has some good steam capsule experience and was really easy to work with.
## Post-release marketing
I emailed around 20 youtubers keys to the game. [Here's the email template I used.](https://i.imgur.com/3jgEIhW.png)
I created the list of youtubers to email using the strategies outlined in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukw_vTFjSDo). As an aside, I highly recommend Aurodev's channel, I followed a lot of his tips for setting up my steam page, creating builds in steamworks, etc.

I didn't have the time nor patience to set up an official presskit, so I just created an ["unofficial" presskit](https://imgur.com/a/prv0qRh) on imgur with relevant artwork. This seemed sufficient for all the influencers that eventually made videos of the game.

As I mentioned earlier, 3 large youtubers and a number of small youtubers made videos on the game.
## Analysis
In this section, I'll outline my thoughts on my results and my process.
### What didn't go so well
#### Game Balance
The game is very easy to "break". There are quite a few spells that sound cool in theory, but utterly steamroll the entire game in practice. Without fail, every influencer that played the game was able to identify these strategies and basically 'autopilot' the entire final 60% of the game. The game is meant to be a challenging dodge-based shoot-em-up, but in many influencer videos, it became an idle game due to these strategies.

In a later patch, I nerfed some of these more egregious strategies, but the damage was "done" so to speak, as many of my initial players had lost interest in the game due to how easy it was.

#### Amount of Content
Even for 3 dollars, the game launched with less content than people had probably expected. If the game were properly balanced, I'd expect most people to beat it within 10 runs. Each run ranges from 30 minutes to 1 hour, so this is a solid 5-10 hours of content.

However, due to the aforementioned balance issues, many players beat the game on their first run. In response to this, I added a number of "challenge modes" (similar to the "Heat" gauge in hades) that drastically increase the challenge of the game. I also added "endless mode". With these updates, I think the game is well-worth the 3 dollar pricetag, but on release I can see how some players would find it light on content.

#### Shallow progression
I think the game's core mechanic of "Every N shots, do something cool" is great. However, many of the subsequent upgrades / progressions are very boring. Once you pick up your core set of spells, the upgrades are largely just "+2 ice damage", "+5 fire damage", "-15% reload speed" etc. The youtubers that played the game seemed reasonably engaged by the magic spells, but seemed to just gloss over the upgrade system becuase it was so boring.

#### No amount of influencer traffic can out-market your game's quality
If you look at my results, you'd think "hey that's not bad for no marketing!". Then you see that I had multiple youtubers with 100k-500k subscribers cover the game and suddenly you're like: What happened? I think it's clear that my game just isn't that great.

My game had far more chances to succeed than it probably deserved (many games with 0 influencer traffic sell better on day 1 than my game did on 3 weeks with influencers covering it). It feels like I wasted an opportunity that could have been better-used by a much better game. I won't vent about this too much more, I just want to say: Imagine if I had made a great game! The amount of influencer traffic I received would have rocketed my game to the moon if my game were better.

### What went well

TODO fill this out

also talk about play time, niche game, etc

### Closing thoughts
talk about how you don't think the game is bad, but rather niche
