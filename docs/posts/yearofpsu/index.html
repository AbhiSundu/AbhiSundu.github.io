"><p>I released <a href="https://store.Steampowered.com/app/2053360/PUTRID_SHOT_ULTRA">Putrid Shot Ultra</a> on Steam roughly one year ago, on November 7, 2022.</p>
<img src="/images/putridshot.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<h2 id="sales">Sales</h2>
<p>The game sold around 840 units on Steam in the ~1 year since its release. The game also has around 1800 outstanding wishlists.
<img src="/images/PSUSales_1Year.png" alt="sales_graph"></p>
<p>In the first month, the game sold around 300 units, so it&rsquo;s definitely surpassed my expectations one year later.
The sales graph for the game shows spikes during every Steam sale/discount after the release:</p>
<p><img src="/images/PSUSalesTraffic_1Year.png" alt="sales_graph"></p>
<p>With the exception of the first Steam winter sale, each subsequent discount resulted in around 20-40 additoinal units sold. I discounted the game in an increasing fashion, increasing by about 5% every 3 or so discounts. Steam allows you to set discounts in advance, so every few months I spend ~5 minutes scheduling future discounts.</p>
<h2 id="reviews-and-reception">Reviews and Reception</h2>
<p>The game currently has 32 reviews, all positive:
<img src="/images/positive32reviews.png" alt="sales_graph"></p>
<p>While the reviews are all positive, I think this is more of a &lsquo;rotten tomatoes&rsquo; 100%, if that makes sense:</p>
<p><img src="/images/mehreview.png" alt="sales_graph"></p>
<p>As we can see, while the reviews are positive, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a 10/10. The general tone is &ldquo;not bad for the price&rdquo;, so it&rsquo;s probably a solid 5 or 6/10 for most.</p>
<p>The playtimes of the reviews tell the real story: While a few players sunk 10+ hours into the game, most players seemed to be done after an hour or so.
<img src="/images/medianplaytime.png" alt="sales_graph">
One complete &ldquo;run&rdquo; of the game takes between 45 minutes to an hour, so this means most players either played a handful of unsuccessful runs, or stopped playing shortly after they won their first run.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<h3 id="what-actually-went-wrong">What actually went wrong?</h3>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s sort of a shallow game. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that; For 3 bucks or less, it&rsquo;s got a solid amount of reasonably-polished content, but I think I invested my time in the wrong areas during development.</p>
<h4 id="replay-value-vs-consumable-content">Replay value vs consumable content</h4>
<p>Roguelikes tend to live or die based on how replayable they are. This means the variety of builds and playstyles needs to be really high. I thought I accomplished this with the 8 unique &lsquo;active spells&rsquo; the player could equip at the start of the run, but these don&rsquo;t change your playstyle enough.
<img src="/images/psu_oars.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Active spell: Swarthy Oars</i></p></p>
<p>The active spells are basically your &lsquo;secondary&rsquo; fire: An ability that charges up over time and does something cool. However, because they&rsquo;re secondary modes of interaction, they only change your playstyle when you choose to activate them, which is every 10-20 seconds or so. You&rsquo;re still shooting the same weapon the whole game.</p>
<p>In fact, most upgrades trigger automatically when you shoot, so even at the end of a run when you&rsquo;re meant to be a literal god, your playstyle is still the same: Shoot for a bit, roll around, repeat. I think this led to most players getting bored after a couple runs (which ends up being ~1 hour of gameplay).</p>
<p>I had been working on adding new starting weapons to the game that would drastically change your playstyle, but I lost interest in updating the game after a couple months.</p>
<p><img src="/images/PSU_secretweapons.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A prototype for an alternate starting weapon</i></p></p>
<p>Instead, before release, I spent most of my time on enemy and boss variety.</p>
<p>I think the game has a ton of variety in this way: There are 24 unique enemy types in the game, and 10 unique bosses and minibosses in the game, all with unique attacks and attack patterns. In general, I think I&rsquo;m really good at boss attack-pattern design, i.e coming up with attacks that are complicated enough to be engaging but still fun to dodge and play with.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think roguelike players really care about this. For example, I don&rsquo;t really care which boss I&rsquo;m facing in a game like Risk of Rain 2: It&rsquo;s just a big health bar that I get to watch tick down. If I had spent less time on enemy and boss design and more time on adding new ways to play the game, I think it would have been more successful.</p>
<p>Bosses and enemies are &lsquo;consumable&rsquo;, so adding them to my game was only &lsquo;additive&rsquo; in terms of content. Adding &ldquo;new ways to play&rdquo; makes all existing content more interesting, so adding a new character or weapon is &lsquo;multiplicative&rsquo; in terms of content.</p>
<p>All that said, I don&rsquo;t have many regrets here: I enjoy making bosses, and Putrid Shot Ultra&rsquo;s bosses are really fun. In the future I&rsquo;ll probably prioritize making systems that give you a better playstyle variety, and <em>then</em> make some cool bosses.</p>
<p>I also think the stage variety is too low. There aren&rsquo;t many stage variants, so the only real &lsquo;procedural&rsquo; aspect to the game is the upgrades you find. Some players even called this out in the reviews, mentioning that there wasn&rsquo;t enough level variety. In the future, I&rsquo;ll probably spend more time on level generation.</p>
<h4 id="the-art-is-bad">The art is bad</h4>
<p>Previously I&rsquo;d said that I stood by the game&rsquo;s art style, saying it was meant to be &lsquo;retro&rsquo;, but I think I&rsquo;m lying to myself: The game looks bad. I think the idea behind the aesthetic is good, but my execution was not. I&rsquo;m sure a good artist could take the same aesthetic and make it look 10x better, but I&rsquo;m not a good artist (yet).</p>
<img src="/images/psu_finalzone.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>I also intentionally cut a ton of corners art-wise to shorten dev time, so the art is bad even with respect to my own actual skill level.</p>
<p>My newest roguelike <a href="https://abhimonk.itch.io/spectral-slash">Spectral Slash</a> is probably much closer to my art skill ceiling right now:
<img src="/images/spectralSlash.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;good art&rdquo; is a hard-requirement for a game to be successful, but I think it helps a ton. I&rsquo;ve seen games with honestly clunky mechanics sell decently-well thanks to solid art. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something a solo dev needs to invest a <em>ton</em> into, but it&rsquo;s one of those things where you need to <em>at least</em> clear some minimum bar of art quality, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m there just yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been practicing art a decent amount in 2023, and I plan to practice a lot more this year since I&rsquo;ll have more free time. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll keep improving and eventually be able to make better game art.</p>
<h4 id="i-spent-way-too-much-energy-marketing">I spent way too much energy marketing</h4>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I feel like most marketing is a waste of time for a solo dev. I think the bare minimum marketing is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post a demo to Steam + itch</li>
<li>Make at-most 1 post to reddit</li>
<li>Send free keys to streamers / youtubers</li>
<li>Enter Steam festivals</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything outside of that feels like a waste of energy. The above 4 steps account for basically all of my game&rsquo;s sales. Maybe I&rsquo;d feel differently if I had a hit game that went viral on TikTok, but those games probably get even more traction from the above 4 steps anyway.</p>
<p>I also spent a long time obsessing over reddit posts, tweets, and my Steam tags. I shuffled the game&rsquo;s tags around multiple times before release to see if anything would fix my game&rsquo;s abysmal wishlist rate, but of course none of it worked because my game lacked <em>the stuff</em>.</p>
<p>Even more than the time investment, I spent way too many <em>brain cycles</em> thinking about marketing. I constantly lamented my game&rsquo;s poor performance pre-release, venting my frustrations into a hidden devlog instead of actually working on my game.</p>
<p>In the future, I&rsquo;ll stick to the above 4 steps, maybe with a <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/marketing-free-games/">little extra</a>, and spend the rest of my time making something cool.</p>
<h3 id="what-actually-went-well">What actually went well?</h3>
<h4 id="it-only-took-200-hours-to-make">It only took 200 hours to make</h4>
<p>Much of that time was doing &lsquo;Steam stuff&rsquo; and QoL that I&rsquo;ll never have to do again, so my next commercial game will take even less time. Also: I&rsquo;ve spent more than 200 hours on plenty of projects that never saw the light of day, and yet I spent only 200 hours on this game? and it earned me 2 grand?? Yes! Haha Yes!!</p>
<p>For me, this is the optimal dev time for a short Steam game. I think my next commercial game will be similarly-scoped.</p>
<h4 id="the-music-kicks-ass">The music kicks ass</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m so damn proud of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abhisundu/sets/putrid-shot-ultra-ost">OST</a>. I still listen to it regularly just for fun. Hell, I&rsquo;m probably the only person that still listens to it, but it&rsquo;s seriously my best work. Maybe that&rsquo;s sad, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The main motif is super catchy and each track has a cool way of using it while also progressively introducing new ideas. The tracks are all pretty balanced too, which is uncommon for me since I never really learned how to &lsquo;master&rsquo; a track.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve improved my music workflow since then, so I think my next full OST will be even better.</p>
<h4 id="a-few-people-loved-the-game">A few people loved the game</h4>
<p>It always blows my mind that people are still playing this game. I know a couple players that clocked 20+ hours in my dinky little 3 dollar game.</p>
<p>Having a handful of people, people who have no personal connection to me, <em>truly love</em> something I&rsquo;ve made, makes this feel like a success regardless of the sales.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p><a href="https://abhisundu.com/posts/gamedevlottery/">In the past</a>, I think I&rsquo;d been a bit too precious about all of this. Making money off of games is cool and good, and I&rsquo;m going to keep doing it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to beat myself up for charging money; I don&rsquo;t need to beat myself up for not making <em>the next big thing</em>; I don&rsquo;t need to feel guilty or unskilled for any of this.</p>
<p>I want to gain even more &rsquo;emotional poise&rsquo; this new year. I thought I was ready for a commercial release last year, but goddamn, hitting that &lsquo;release&rsquo; button and watching reviews, videos, and bug reports roll in was terrifying. I was constantly anxious. If I had known how anxious I&rsquo;d be, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have even released the game.</p>
<p>The only way to get tankier is to just keep increasing volume, so I want to keep releasing games this year. I want to experiment with stuff outside my comfort zone, and then crush something in my wheelhouse. I want to keep improving every aspect of my gamedev skills.</p>
<p>Until then, I&rsquo;m happy with my first Steam game. I&rsquo;m glad I made it.</p>
