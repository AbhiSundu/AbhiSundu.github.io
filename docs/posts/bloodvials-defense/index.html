<p style="text-align: center;"><i>People really hate farming blood vials</i></p></p>
<p>This is a pretty common criticism of Bloodborne, especially since the healing system is so different from Dark Souls&rsquo;s renowned estus flask system. &ldquo;Why would the developers ever force the player to &ldquo;farm&rdquo; a healing item? This just makes me madder. I just want to keep fighting the boss!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="take-a-break-kid">Take a break, kid</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go take a break. You&rsquo;ve died to this guy like 30 times already, go do something else for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what Bloodborne is telling the player with its blood vial system. If you&rsquo;ve died to a boss so many times that you&rsquo;re out of blood vials, then you probably need to go do something else.</p>
<p>But wait, what if it&rsquo;s early in the game? You don&rsquo;t have that many vials to begin with, so why make me grind?
But wait, what if it&rsquo;s late in the game? You seriously think I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing? Let me keep fighting the boss, I&rsquo;ll have you know I&rsquo;m a <em>souls veteran</em>&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="early-game-go-learn-something">Early game: Go learn something</h3>
<p><img src="/images/clericbeast.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Image source: https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Cleric&#43;Beast</i></p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the early game: You only start with 20 vials. Oh no, you died to the Cleric Beast! That&rsquo;s 20 vials down the drain. Go farm some vials and practice the combat. You know who always drops 2-3 blood vials? The big boys. Go kill a bunch of them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that? They&rsquo;re hard for you to kill at this level? Good. Keep fighting them. Don&rsquo;t come back till you&rsquo;ve killed 20 of them. Learn to dodge, learn to parry, learn the mechanics of your trick weapon, and <em>then</em> come back to Father Gascoine.</p>
<h3 id="late-game-take-a-breather">Late game: Take a breather</h3>
<p>I get it, Orphan of Kos is hard. But you&rsquo;re tilted, I can tell. You&rsquo;ve died to that stupid four hit stunlock combo like 30 times already, go do something else. Do a chalice dungeon or something. Beat up one of those procedurally generated bosses (&ldquo;The Watchdog of Anus&rdquo; or whatever its called).</p>
<p>Come back tomorrow. You&rsquo;ll beat it on your second try, I promise.</p>
<h2 id="eat-your-vegetables-game-design">&ldquo;Eat your Vegetables&rdquo; game design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One of the responsibilities of designers is to protect the player from themselves</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Sid Meier and Soren Johnson, designers of the Civilization series</p>
<p>An example: The game &ldquo;Transistor&rdquo; previously had a system that discouraged players from using the same abilities for the whole game. Amir Rao from Supergiant games calls this &ldquo;Eat your Vegetables&rdquo; game design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Previously, I said we were trying to discourage players from sitting on the same powers all game long and denying themselves a deeper and more varied experience. That sentiment came from a very &rsquo;eat your vegetables&rsquo; school of game design that I think many developers can be prone to. You see a relatively natural path-of-least-resistance sort of behavior in your players that you want to discourage, so you try to design all the ways in which it will be thwarted.&quot;</em>
<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-design-deep-dive-the-functions-of-i-transistor-i-">(source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Transistor, &ldquo;Eat your vegetables&rdquo; meant preventing easy, &rsquo;low-resistance&rsquo; strategies. In Bloodborne, it means keeping the player&rsquo;s mental game &lsquo;healthy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When Bloodborne takes the reigns away from the player and says &ldquo;take a break&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s almost like telling the player to &ldquo;eat your vegetables&rdquo;. Bloodborne&rsquo;s designers know that players who bash their heads against a boss for hours will get frustrated. In an attempt to prevent this frustration and give the player a more varied and <em>healthy</em> experience, they step in and say &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had enough meat. It&rsquo;s time for some vegetables&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve died 50 times, go do something else.</p>
<p>Ironically, it seems like this has had the opposite effect on many players. That said, this type of forced-pacing has actually been a staple of FromSoftware games since Demon&rsquo;s Souls, though players knew it by a different name back then:</p>
<h3 id="the-boss-runback">The &ldquo;boss runback&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Dying in a FromSoft game sends you back to the nearest checkpoint. Dying to any boss in Demon&rsquo;s Souls up to Dark Souls 3 usually meant returning to the start of the entire level and running all the way back to the boss (taking any shortcuts you may have found).</p>
<p>The runback existed not just to reward players for exploring the level and finding shortcuts, but also to introduce a moment of reflection to the player. While running back to the boss, you&rsquo;re no longer actively &ldquo;in combat&rdquo;. Instead, you&rsquo;re auto-piloting through the level, still mentally chewing on your most recent death. I find that I come up with the best strategies during these runbacks. &ldquo;I should probably roll towards the boss during <em>that</em> attack. I can only get in 2 hits after that other attack&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>At the very least, it introduces a gap in the pacing of a boss battle. An tough fight coupled with a tragic death makes my heart race. Having that small gap in-between the end of a fight and the start of the next attempt is a good &lsquo;mental reset&rsquo; for me.</p>
<p><img src="/images/stakeOfMarika.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Image source: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stakes&#43;of&#43;Marika</i></p></p>
<p>In contrast, Elden Ring has &ldquo;stakes of marika&rdquo; that respawn you right outside the boss door. This almost feels like giving up on Fromsoft&rsquo;s part: &ldquo;We get it, you hate the runback. You hate your vegetables. Fine, here&rsquo;s your ice cream, go nuts.&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="bloodbornes-intent-is-clear">Bloodborne&rsquo;s intent is clear</h2>
<p>The designers are no fools. They knew they could have re-used the Estus system just fine, and no one would have complained. But making the blood vial system was a calculated gamble to see if they could alleviate some frustration by motivating practice and exploration after repeated deaths. I think this experiment was a huge success.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? This is basically Elden Ring.</p>
<p>In Elden Ring, if you die over and over again to a boss, you&rsquo;re motivated to leave and explore, only to return when you&rsquo;re stronger. The core of this motivation is the same as Bloodborne&rsquo;s: Take a breather, go explore and practice, and come back when you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>The main difference is that in Elden Ring, the player is more <em>intrinsically</em> motivated to explore. &ldquo;Damn, this guy killed me in 2 hits. I&rsquo;m probably underleveled. I wonder what&rsquo;s south of the bridge over there&hellip;&rdquo;. Whereas, in Bloodborne, the game was <em>extrinsically</em> motivating the player, saying &ldquo;You literally cannot fight this boss again, go do something else&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The sentiment is the same, but the source is different. In the end, I think that&rsquo;s where the frustration with blood vials comes from. In Elden Ring, it feels like <em>your</em> idea to go explore. In Bloodborne, it&rsquo;s Miyazaki putting a plate of greens down and saying &ldquo;eat&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</strong></p>
<p>Not sure if I&rsquo;ll do more &ldquo;design&rdquo;-related articles, but this one was fun to write. It feels cool and taboo to have a contrarian take for once lmao.
