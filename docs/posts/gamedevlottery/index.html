"><p>Ever since I released my first commercial game, the temptation to monetize my most fun hobby has been violently oscillating. I wrote a little bit about this in my <a href="https://abhimonk.itch.io/six-cards-under/devlog/472258/six-cards-under-is-now-free-postmortem">post-mortem</a> for my game <a href="https://abhimonk.itch.io/six-cards-under">Six Cards Under</a>, a previously-paid-but-free-now game I released back in October.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like commercial gamedev is my own personal lottery ticket.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-try-enough-ill-eventually-win-right">If I try enough, I&rsquo;ll eventually win, right?</h2>
<p>My first commercial game has sold about 600 units  so far on Steam since its release in November, for a total of around 1500 dollars. This puts its gross hourly rate at about 7.5 dollars per hour.</p>
<p>This is . . . not terrible, right? If I just keep making better and better commercial games, I&rsquo;ll eventually make enough money to quit my job, buy a house, and own my time, right?</p>
<p>And gamedev is even <em>better</em> than the lottery, because it&rsquo;s skill-based. Supergiant games can and will release another smash hit, because they&rsquo;re good at what they do. The guy who made DUSK will probably continue to release bangers because he&rsquo;s good at what he does. If you train hard enough and with enough volume, you&rsquo;ll eventually get huge . . . right??</p>
<h2 id="and-if-i-make-a-free-game-that-blows-up-then--">And if I make a free game that blows up, then. . .</h2>
<p>I <em>have to</em> monetize that, right? When Putrid S4ND got me +100 twitter followers, I <em>had</em> to explore that in a commercial setting, right? It&rsquo;s not much but it&rsquo;s the most I&rsquo;d ever gotten! If I didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;d be leaving money on the table!</p>
<h2 id="but-whats-the-point-i-already-have-a-full-time-job">But what&rsquo;s the point? I already have a full time job!</h2>
<p>Why even charge money for my games though? It&rsquo;ll take a long time for me to get good enough at gamedev to live off of it. Do I really want to penny-pinch my way to a couple extra grand a year? Why did I even charge money for PUTRID SHOT ULTRA?</p>
<p>After taxes and steam&rsquo;s cut, I&rsquo;ll have made just around 1k. Was that really worth denying tens of thousands of people the opportunity to play my game?</p>
<h2 id="my-free-games-have-so-many-players-im-basically-a-bad-person-if-i-charge-money-for-a-game">My free games have so many players, I&rsquo;m basically a bad person if I charge money for a game</h2>
<p>My free games Planet D4RK and TRYH4RD have over 80000 plays combined, with hundreds of adoring comments. A small speedrunning community formed around Planet D4RK, and I <em>still</em> get DMs begging for a TRYH4RD sequel. Someone found my youtube account with 5 subscribers and commented on a completely unrelated video of mine asking if I would please release TRYH4RD 2!</p>
<p>By charging money for my games, I&rsquo;m basically a horrible person, right? I&rsquo;m like the worst capitalist ever. I already have <em>enough</em>. I make plenty of money at my cushy tech job, have an amazing work life balance, and I still for some reason feel the need to charge money for my games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just gross excess, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m no better than the rich CEO that still takes surplus value from his workers. Even if I make it big, so what? Say I made 100k on a game. Why is that a good thing? I already <em>have enough</em>, why do I need more?</p>
<h2 id="are-you-saying-people-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-for-their-labor-you-really-are-a-horrible-person">Are you saying people don&rsquo;t deserve to be paid for their labor? You really are a horrible person!</h2>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s different. Those developers need the money, some of them are literally starving. They deserve <em>more</em> for their labor. But I&rsquo;m different, I already have a job that I can live off of, I don&rsquo;t need more money.</p>
<h2 id="so-youre-saying-youre-better-than-those-devs">So you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re better than those devs?</h2>
<p>Not at all, oh god what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<h5 id="you-think-youre-a-savior-giving-your-games-out-for-free">You think you&rsquo;re a savior, giving your games out for free.</h5>
<h5 id="your-games-arent-even-good-the-only-reason-people-play-them-is-because-theyre-free">Your games aren&rsquo;t even good. The only reason people play them is because they&rsquo;re free.</h5>
<h5 id="you-think-youre-better-than-the-devs-that-depend-on-their-games-for-income">You think you&rsquo;re better than the devs that depend on their games for income.</h5>
<h5 id="you-think-youre-above-charging-for-your-game">You think you&rsquo;re above charging for your game.</h5>
<h5 id="youre-greedy-you-have-more-than-enough-and-youre-still-unsatisfied">You&rsquo;re greedy, you have more than enough and you&rsquo;re still unsatisfied.</h5>
<h5 id="you-want-adoring-fans-that-will-throw-their-money-at-you-and-tell-you-youre-a-good-person">You want adoring fans that will throw their money at you and tell you you&rsquo;re a good person.</h5>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="and-it-repeats">And it repeats</h2>
<p>Ever since PUTRID SHOT ULTRA, I&rsquo;ve been cycling through the above again and again. I went as far as to make all my itch content free because I convinced myself that I don&rsquo;t need this money and that I was being greedy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a new game now: A roguelike deckbuilder, because some marketing consultant told me it would make money (though I&rsquo;ve now learned that apparently it should have been a lo-fi horror game).</p>
<p>The game feels genuinely good. It&rsquo;s got a new twist on the formula, and it&rsquo;s got a really extendable core gameplay loop. I could easily crank out 5 zones with a few stages each, a few dozen passive items, and 20-30 cards in 6-7 months. The game looks way better than my other games too. The art style is way more cohesive and higher resolution that I&rsquo;ve done in the past. I fixed a bunch of issues in my engine and added some neat post-processing and lighting effects too.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is: If I wanted to, I could dump the next 6 months of my hobby time into this game and probably sell at least 5x as much as my last commercial game.</p>
<p>But goddamn, I don&rsquo;t want to. Or do I? I have no idea. If I made 5 grand on this game, would that make a meaningful impact on my life? I could just donate it, but like, I can donate my money right now if I wanted to.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s so satisfying having people enjoy your work enough to <em>pay for it</em>. It feels like the ultimate victory under capitalism. Instead of wage labor, I&rsquo;ve created something <em>with my own two hands</em>, and others have willingly and publically recognized the value of my work.</p>
<p>But also I&rsquo;m so sick of making this game already. Or am I? Some days I love working on it. Other days I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just descope everything to 1 zone, 10 cards, 1 boss and call it a day&rdquo;. But then I&rsquo;m like: what if the game does well? Did I miss my chance to make it big? What if I release it for free and a ton of people love it? I could have made some <em>money</em> right? I should release a steam version after that, right?</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-make-games">Why do I make games?</h2>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know. I know I love coding, and making games gives me the chance to just vomit gallons upon gallons of untested, unproven, uncensored code without any oversight. That&rsquo;s pretty neat!</p>
<p>I also love seeing whatever code I write manifest into something interactive. I write software tools for engineers at my day job, so it scratches a similar itch I guess.</p>
<p>I also love when people play my games, but it feels weirdly dirty to have such an external and fickle motivator.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a lie. It doesn&rsquo;t feel dirty to love when people play your games. It feels <em>terrifying</em>. The thought of pouring my soul into something over the course of a year, and then releasing it to radio silence terrifies me.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I released a game called Jingnon&rsquo;s Ascent (yes that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s actually called).</p>
<img src="/images/jingnon.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>I spent over a year on this game. This was my magnum opus. I still boot it up from time to time and think &ldquo;wow, I knocked this out of the park&rdquo;. Sure, the game has the classic &ldquo;new dev&rdquo; jank to it, but to this day I&rsquo;m still impressed by how fun it is.</p>
<p>The game got probably 20-30 downloads, and even fewer plays. I fell into a pretty deep depression after releasing that game.</p>
<h2 id="releasing-free-games-is-my-ultimate-defense">Releasing free games is my ultimate defense</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with releasing free games, but sometimes I feel like I make free games not because of some altruistic creative spirit inside of me, but because I know that as long as it&rsquo;s</p>
<ul>
<li>free<br>
and</li>
<li>playable in a browser</li>
</ul>
<p>then <em>someone</em> will play it. If I charge money for it, maybe I strike gold and make a ton of money. Maybe I make just a little bit of money and feel bad about myself. But if it&rsquo;s free, none of that matters, and I get to avoid the emptiness for just a little longer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll make another commercial game. I feel like I need to. Like, I need to put my name in the hat, I need just one more scratch-off and then I&rsquo;ll win big. But that&rsquo;s a shitty way to look at a hobby that I really love.</p>
<p>At the very least, I know I&rsquo;ll keep making games! That&rsquo;s kinda neat.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</strong></p>
<p>I know no one really reads this blog, but this post felt good to write. I wonder how many other devs feel this way? If this post resonated with you at all, feel free to hit me up at <a href="mailto:abhisundugames@gmail.com">abhisundugames@gmail.com</a> or dm me on <a href="https://twitter.com/abhisundu">twitter</a>. I love hearing how other indies feel about their most time-consuming hobby.</p>
