      <description>Over the past three and a half years, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent 938 hours making different games. The games ranged from short projects taking only 20-30 hours to much longer projects taking upwards of 200 hours with many unfinished projects scattered in between.
While some went unfinished, most of the projects ended up shipping in one way or another. In tracking my gamedev time, I learned how long it takes me to &amp;ldquo;make a thing&amp;rdquo;, what types of projects cause me to burn out, and how time tracking affects the way I work in general.</description>
