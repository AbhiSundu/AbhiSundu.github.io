# Most games are bad, so I can just make a GOOD game!
I see this take a lot on /r/gamedev, here are some examples:

<insert examples>

These posts are usually made by someone working on their first game. They've read various reddit postmortems about failed games, and they see their game as above those 'failed' games.

It's easy to look at the bottom percentile of steam games and say "I can do better than that!", but the problem is:

1. Most people are bad at gamedev
2. Being good at gamedev doesn't mean you'll make money

Point 1 basically means: OP is likely just as bad at gamedev as the people they're saying are beneath them.
Point 2 means: It's not enough to be good at gamedev. You have to be *great*, *excellent* at gamedev to actually make a lot of money on steam. "Good" gamedevs will max out at around 50-100 reviews (1500-3000 sales). The top spots, the life-changing career-driving money, is made by a static number (*not* percentile) of games every year.

# Common mental pitfalls related to the above

## Have you *seen* the trash on steam? It wouldn't take much effort to beat that!
If it doesn't take much, then it's probably not worth much.

Beating out the bottom percentile of shovelware games on steam really just means your game is elevated to the "nice trash" tier on steam. Maybe you'll sell like 100-1500 units, but then your game will stop selling.

There's nothing wrong with this tier. My first Steam game falls squarely in this tier (at the moment of writing this, my first game's sold around 1200 units). It's just that this tier is full of *decently skilled* hobbyists. The odds are pretty low that you, a random first-timer who gets their wisdom from *fucking /r/gamedev lmao*, will even make it to this tier.

This is like when new sub-level-30 LoL players talk trash about bronze and iron players. Most of these players' watch "fail compilations" on youtube and laugh at all the "silver plays". Then, they play their first ranked game go 0-10 against the iron Katarina one-trick. It turns out, even the bottom of the ladder is better than you!

## What about <insert solodev whose first game was a success>?
They're exceptional. By definition, they're uncommon. If you think your game is the next Balatro, then honestly I respect you. Use that confidence to ship like 10 games and come back to me.
