Games with 'tight' controls usually feature an assortment of hidden "assists" that secretly cheat in favor of the player (i.e "coyote time"). I think these assist's can be broadly categorized into two main buckets:

## Anticipating / Understanding Player Intent
Using "coyote time" as an example: This assist understands that the player 'intended' to jump, even if they jumped too late. Realizing this intent means letting the player jump anyway. Another quick example would be Dead Cells automatically flipping the player if they attack the opposite direction of an enemy. Dead Cells understands that the player intended to hit that enemy, and corrects the mistake.

## Forgiving Common Mistakes
A lot of these assists fit into both this category and the above category. Using "coyote time" as an example again, the player made a common mistake: pressing jump a little bit too late after leaving a platform.

Coyote time means forgiving the player for this mistake, and realizing their intention anyway.

# Examples of Assists

## Input buffering

## Animation cancelling

## Hitbox sizing

## Position-snapping

# Application of Assists

## Preventing the player from 'whiffing' attacks
[talk about how in hyper light drifter, the attack hitbox is HUGE]
[talk about how in Kingdom Hearts, you snap to the enemy]
[show examples from spectral slash combining the two]
[tradeoffs between snapping and making attack hitbox big]

## Making dodging feel "responsive"
[talk about fromsoft input buffering]
[talk about KH and DMC animation cancelling]
[talk about tradeoffs]
[some indie soulslikes don't do this and suffer]

## Making "combos" easier
[input buffering]

## Forgiving the player for a mis-timing
[talk about Planet D4RK slash intent and forgiveness]

## Barely dodging attacks
[talk about gungeon hitboxes and how they're small]

## Bonus: Use Anti-assists to motivate certain playstyles
[in sekiro, the dodge has so few iframes, it punishes dodging. motivate parrying]
