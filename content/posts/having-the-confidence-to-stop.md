Now and then, I'll read something that completely rewires my brain. It's not that what I've read actively rewires my brain, but that I was 99% of the way there, and then I read something that brings me that extra 1% that completely changes the way I think about something.

[Localthunk](https://localthunk.com/), the solodev creator of the multi-million dollar hit [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), wrote a post called "[Balatro Timeline](https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh)". In that post, he has a passage in March 2022, quote:

>*"I have been making games for about 10 years now and I have been doing visual art projects for much longer, and a very important habit I have developed for creative hobby projects is to stop working on something when I no longer feel the drive. This is for 2 main reasons; first, it allows me to move on to the next idea without totally burning out on the last thing. Second, and more importantly in this case, it allows me to take time off guilt free and possibly come back to the project later on without wrapping it in negative emotions.*"
- Localthunk

This is not the first time I've come across this idea. It is, however, the first time this idea has led to a *rewiring* of my brain. This was the "last 1%" that I needed to hear to trigger something inside me.

There are a few high-level ideas expressed here:
* Not forcing yourself to do something
* Allowing yourself to explore
* "Guilt-free" time off
* Burnout caused by pushing yourself (associating negative feelings with the project)
* Returning to a project later on

## Not forcing yourself to do something
This tweet is the first thing that put my brain on this rewiring path:

>*"my contrarian opinion is that doing things you don't want to do is incredibly bad for you. all the advice that says to grind is bullshit. you just end up teaching yourself that you don't value your intrinsic motivations, and over time those vanish, leaving you empty"

The opposite of this tweet is basically "only work on stuff when you're *obsessed* with it". Once that obsession fades, and you're left with the stuff you don't care about, maybe you can just stop?

## Allowing yourself to explore
I always have tons of ideas I want to mess around with, but when I'm actively working on a game, I usually don't allow myself to explore those other ideas. It feels like I'm "cheating" on my main project. Like, why spend time on this new thing? I still haven't even finished the old thing!

I think this is what has caused me to resent longer projects. It's also why most of my last few projects have been gamejam games: These games don't live long enough for me to resent them. They're immortalized in their obsession honeymoon phase.

## Guilt-free time off
My fiance (whose family was raised catholic) always said that I must have been catholic in a previous life because of how much guilt I impose on myself. I find it very hard to take "time off" from a creative project.

That's not to say I need to work on the project 100% of the time. I'm actually quite good about spreading out gamedev time. I tend to only work on long projects for a couple hours a week.

I think it's really important to periodically give yourself space from your game, as that's when your best ideas will come to you.

However, I've never taken time off from a long project to work on a *different project*. I'd feel too guilty if I did that.

## Burnout
Not too much to say here. I'm pretty sure every gamedev has felt burnout from forcing themselves to work on a creative project for too long. Over time, this leads to an aversion to long projects (like what I've been feeling).

## Returning to a project later
This is one of the most interesting things localthunk mentioned. I feel like this requires so much confidence. The confidence that, if this project is really meant to be worked on for more time, then you *will* return to it. If not, you need to be confident enough to let it go.

This is where my brain has been rewired. I realize now: If a project really is worth coming back to, I will simply come back to it. If not, I can rest knowing that I must not have been interested enough in the first place.

## TODO figure out what to do with this post
I want this post to mostly highlight what localthunk said. I think we should reword it or something or make it shorter.
