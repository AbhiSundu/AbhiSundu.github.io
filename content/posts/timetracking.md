Over the past 3 years, I've spent  hours making  different games. The games ranged from short projects taking only 20-30 hours to much longer projects taking upwards of 200 hours. Many of the projects did not see the light of day, but most of the projects ended up shipping in one way or another.

## Time Tracking as a Productivity Hack
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with self-improvement and "life hacking". I'd mainline every ted talk, article, and lifehack reddit post I could get my fingerless gloves on, drinking in the fantasy of turning into the perfect version of myself.

Nowadays, while I'm a bit more disillusioned to self-improvement as a genre, the world of "Time management self-help" is still one of my guilty pleasures.

**ok this book is actually decent though**

It's a pretty common productivity "hack" to use a timer as a way of keeping you focused. The act of starting a timer forces me to acknowledge beginning a task, which makes me more likely to be focused at the beginning. The ticking of the timer increase the guilt I feel when I go 'off task', working on something else or distracting myself. In this way, starting a timer is a good way to execute focused work (or "deep work" if you're a fucking nerd), and I'd recommend it for those reasons.

Being able to press stop on a timer also gives me an opportunity to really let go of whatever I was just working on. This isn't to say I don't think about my games when I'm not working on them, but being able to literally press stop makes it easier for me to mentally do the same.

I started tracking time as a way to find more time in my day for my many hobbies. I started off recording everything, like time spent watching TV, playing games, mindless browsing, and hobbies to see where I was 'wasting time'. Tracking everything I did ended up being a huge pain, so nowadays I only record how much time I spend on hobbies and work.

Since then, my goal became to better-understand how long it takes me to actually *make things*, so I could better-scope my projects around a tight schedule. I ended up learning a lot about how long it takes me to create a certain amount of gameplay, and how that time scales with respect to a game's scope. I also learned that tracking your time can cause you to optimize the time you spend in interesting ways, both good and bad.

## Logistics
I use an app called aTracker (disclaimer: I am not sponsored by this app). It has a free version that I used for the first year with good success but I've since upgraded to the paid version to avoid the ads. For every new gamedev project I start, I create a new "task" on the app.

**Show atracker UI**

Whenever I'm about to work on the project, I tap the project to start the timer and stop the timer when I stop working. When I'm finshed with a project, I archive the task on the app. The app keeps track of the total time spent on each task, so with the above workflow I can measure how long it takes me to "make a thing".

## How long does it take me to make a thing?
To start, let's look at some overall data:


**show graph of increasing time spent on gamedev for each game**
I spent **INSERT AMOUNT** hours on gamedev in the past three years, ranging from tiny 1-2 week projects (~20-30 hours) to multi-month commercial ordeals. Since my goal was to better understand how long each "unit of content" takes for me to create, let's graph the amount of time spent on each game VS the amount of "content" in each game in terms of hours.

**show graph of hours spent (x axis) vs content in game (y axis)**

Not a huge surprise here, the longer I spend on a game, the more content I can create. **TODO make some statement on the slope or curve**

You'll notice that the games I make tend to fall into one of three buckets:
- Short project (20-40 hours)
- Medium project (50-90 hours)
- Long project (150-200 hours)

## Short Projects (20-40 hours)
These were usually PICO-8 games. The PICO-8 restriction model forces me to ship games roughly at the 30 hour mark unless I'm working overtime on music and story. PICO-8 prevents you from having more than 8192 symbols in your code (which translates to around 2000 lines of lua code), which usually takes me around 30 hours to write.

**List the 20-40 hour projects with links and time spent on each**
**SH4DE, Cards of the bog, PUTRID S4NDs, Olden Peak, TRYH4RD jam version, Six Cards Under**

To be honest, these games probably had the best "fulfillment-to-effort" ratio. I'd spend between 1-3 weeks on a simple idea, expand on it as much as I could in that time, and then ship a game. Each of these games got thousands of plays on itch.io, despite only taking a few weeks to make. I never once got sick of working on any of these games due to their short development cycle.

## Medium Projects (50-90 hours)


## Long Projects (150+ hours)
These are the "soulsuckers" of hobbyist gamedev. The ones you wish you'd never started; The ones you want to quit if not for their sunk costs; The ones where you don't care about how well they're received, because you're just happy that you shipped.

**List the 150 hour projects**
**Dreams of D4RK, Jingnon's ascent, One Shot Dog, PUTRID SHOT ULTRA**

One thing you may notice from this is half of these projects are unfinished. I only finished the demo for Dreams of D4Rk, and One Shot Dog never saw the light of day. Jignon's ascent only shipped because I realized I would never finish unless I gave myself a hard deadline. I think these projects are the most 'dangerous' to me as a hobbyist dev. I can really only spend around 1 hour per day on gamedev, so a 200 hour project can easily take me 6 months to a year to complete. This is a *long time* to spend on a single game, especially as one person. The allure of picking up a new technology or running with a new game idea is ever-present and tantalizingly strong.

## Productivity
It's pretty common productivity advice to use a timer as a way of keeping you focused. The act of starting a timer forces me to acknowledge beginning a task, which makes me more likely to be focused at the beginning. The ticking of the timer increase the guilt I feel when I go 'off task', working on something else or distracting myself. In this way, starting a timer is a good way to execute focused work, and I'd recommend it for those reasons.

Being able to press stop on a timer also gives me an opportunity to really let go of whatever I was just working on. This isn't to say I don't think about my games when I'm not working on them, but being able to literally press stop makes it easier for me to mentally do the same.

## Shortcuts and Optimization
When I record something, I naturally start trying to optimize for it.
