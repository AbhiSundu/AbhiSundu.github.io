The only good advice in gamedev is "make lots of small games". However, I think a lot of people misunderstand this advice because they don't understand the *why* behind it.

People smarter than me, with more experience than me, and with better writing than me, have given their own excellent reasons for this. Here are some links!

* [How to make good small games, by Farawaytimes](https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html)
* [Make and relase lots of small games before making a big one, by Tyler Glaiel](https://blog.tylerglaiel.com/p/make-and-release-lots-of-small-games)
* [Getting lots of sleep (and making a game every month) by Adam Pype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb22xeh_VqM)

The above posts/videos are all excellent starting points for understanding why making lots of small games is useful. Here, I'll share some of my own reasons.

(by the way, "Make lots of small games" doesn't literally mean make small games, but rather "make lots of games that don't take you longer than 1-2 months to develop").

## Reason 1: Your "dream game" will change
Your ideal 'dream game' will change a ton over your gamedev lifespan. Making lots of small games is a really good way to avoid over-committing to a 'dream game' that you'll end up hating in a few months anyway.

It's like committing to a college major when you're only 18. You're only 18! How the hell are you supposed to know what you like? Try a bunch of things, see what sticks. Similarly, for your first few games, you probably have no idea what you actually enjoy making.

So, you should just make a lot of different things until you find something that resonates with you.
## Reason 2: Ideas are actually hard
I've seen a lot of gamedevs say that 'execution is all that matters' and that 'ideas are a dime a dozen', but I disagree. *Good* ideas are incredibly difficult to come up with. Coming up with an *achievable*, *fun*, *novel* idea that *also aligns with your skillset* is so stupidly hard, that if you do it, you're almost guaranteed some kind of success. This is where all those breakout 'solodev' hits come from.

So, if you make lots of small games, you'll be able to try out lots of ideas. It'll be obvious if an idea is good or bad, because you'll have finished a small game that demonstrates it, and you (and the audience) will either like it or not.

## Reason 3: You won't get bored
You probably won't get bored working on 12 games in 2 years, but you *might* get bored working on your dream game for 2 years.

Avoiding boredom is like, the best way to get good at stuff. It's seriously the 'one weird trick' that'll make you good at anything. If you can make an activity fun for yourself, you will naturally become more skilled than like 70% of people, because you'll just practice it more than those who don't find it fun.

The 'lack of motivation' to practice something usually stems from not finding the core activity fun enough IMO. I never have motivation problems when I'm actively working on a new game, because I'm not bored of working on it yet. Then, I (ideally) ship the game long before I'd ever get bored of it, so I'm always incredibly stoked to work on my games. When I'm in the thick of a project, I literally cannot think about anything else.

In contrast, in the past, when I had year-long projects, I frequently hated working on gamedev. Working on a 6-month+ project gets soulsucking real fast.

## Reason 4: People will actually play your games
The market for low-cost / free, low-time-investment (web) games is way bigger than the market for 2-year long janky passion projects. I'll play your janky gamejam game because it has a wacky idea and a stupid title, and because I know that at worst, it'll be over in like 20 minutes.

But I will not be touching your ms paint JRPG-inspired multi-year labor of love, I apologize. It causes me too much pain to even look at it.

## Counter arguments and rebuttals:
### "So you're advocating for making a bunch of cheap asset flips?"
No, see [farawaytimes's post](https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html). Small games can (and should) be beautiful in their own ways.

(but also, flipping your own assets is cool and good, and you should do it)

### "Okay I made 10 small games, now can I go work on my dream pixel-art soulslike metroidvania with crafting?"
Sure, but also go read [farawaytimes's post]((https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html)). Small games should not be 'homework' that you need to check-off before working on a thing you like. Just go do the thing you want to do.

### You haven't even made that many games! Why should I listen to you?
This is true, but I think the "lots" in "make lots of small games" is a relative term here. If you're already pumping out 5+ games per year, you're probably way ahead of me anyway. For me, this advice just means to spend less time on each idea.

I used to work exclusively on 6-12 month projects (most of which wouldn't ship), but nowadays I basically stick to 1-2 month projects unless some serious inspiration hits me. I've got a pretty full life - gamedev is only a very small part of it - so 'make lots of games' for me really just means like 2-5 games per year. But also, you don't have to listen to me!

### "What if the game I want to make isn't small? What do I do?"
Simply make the game you want to make. Avoid making the game you don't want to make.

### "Okay wiseass, I'm here for advice. What do I do if my ideas are all too big?"
Okay an actual response: Try to boil your idea down into the smallest elements. For example: If your dream game is a big soulslike and we boiled this down to the barest elements, it would be:

* Pattern-based, methodical combat
* Boss battles
* Interconnected levels
* Character customization

And now we pick a handful of pieces from each of them, ignoring anything that takes too long. So in this case, you could make a short boss rush (3 bosses) with soulslike combat, and maybe at the start of the game you pick either a big slow heavy weapon or a small fast light weapon. You could even make your boss rush hub world a small, interconnected map that has little shortcuts between boss doors.

It requires the same infrastructure, far fewer assets, but still forces you to build the skills required for a soulslike. Then, if you still want to make your dream soulslike, you already have a good starting point. You can apply this to basically any genre. A few other examples:

* Puzzle platformer -> 10 levels with one of the core mechanics you want in your dream game (i.e every itch.io gamejam platformer)
* Metroidvania -> A Metroidvania with 1 boss, 1 zone, only 1 or 2 powerups and a couple enemy types (i.e Robot wants Kitty)
* Action Roguelike -> One zone, 1 boss, 1 character, 10 passives or variants of your core mechanic, a handful of enemy types. MAYBE add unlockables (i.e my game, [Putrid S4nds](https://abhimonk.itch.io/putrid-s4nd))
* Soulslike -> A small boss rush with 3 bosses, your core combat mechanics, and maybe 1 alternate weapon / stat

If you do the above, you'll probably feel one of two things once you finish:
1. That was fun! But now I'm bored, onto the next idea!

or

2. Wow that was awesome. I *need* to make this into a full game.

If it's 1, then congrats! You just avoided a 1+ year slog of working on something you would have grown bored of.

If it's 2, then congrats! You're now *much closer* to actually making a full version of this. (And, if you released your small game, you may have also built up a small audience that's hungry for a full/expanded version)

### "What about my special situation? What about me? I'm different!"
You might be! Or you might not be! Don't listen to me, seriously. ["All advice is bad advice, but no perspective is worse"](https://youtu.be/miwrDpbb25Q?t=2696). Go out there and have your own experiences. Make your dream game and see what happens!

Seriously, it might work out. You might make something really cool. I'm genuinely not being sarcastic here: Take everything I say as just my perspective. It's up to you to forge your own perspective from here.

**---------------------------------------------**

I felt strange writing this post, because I hate giving advice (because I don't feel qualified to give advice). I've only released 19 games in my whole life. That is a *tiny* number. There are devs who make like 10 games per year. Most of those rockstar successful solo devs made like 200+ flash games in the 2000s era. Take everything I say with a ton of salt. Whenever I give any advice, I think about that [Rami Ismail talk I linked](https://youtu.be/miwrDpbb25Q?t=2696). It's really changed my view on basically everything: All advice is just perspective. If someone says "do X to be successful", it needs to mean "they did X and found success, idk about you" or whatever.

But also, don't be afraid to just try stuff. "Make lots of small games" is kind of a proxy for a larger piece of advice, which is "try lots of different things". I feel like the majority of the good things in my life come directly from trying something different.
